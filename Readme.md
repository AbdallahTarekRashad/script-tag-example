# Component example

  This example uses regular script tags and a single list of app-level dependencies
  listed within `./component.json`.

## Running the example

  Clone the repo and run:

```
$ make
```

  That's all the is to it! Or if you don't have make installed run:

```
$ component install
$ component build
```
